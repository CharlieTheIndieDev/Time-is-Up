# Time's-Up
A fun 3D FPS game 
This was my first 3D FPS game set in a zombie apocalypse
I built the 3d character models and the guns used as well as programmed the basic movement and AI mechanics
We also had a teleportation function which I was incharge of and other miscellaneous tasks,
The whole project would not have been possible without our level designer Rare Raven Interactive and the other programmer Paul Oladele (https://github.com/PaulElcampeon)
The game has been released on itch and is available for both Windows and Mac, and has Keyboard and console support. 
The game is released here : https://rare-raven-interactive.itch.io/times-up
